# Natural_Language_Processing

This is where I shall put my NLP work. Some of this work was done during my CS542 class in the Spring of 2019. Additional work was performed by Robert LaMarre and Neha Pawar, but I have decided to not include their work here. This shall be a demonstration of just my work.

You can find the work that I performed in source. There you will see four important files. The first is Simple_Classifiers.ipynb. This is a jupyter notebook that should be fully commented to explain exactly what is being done at each point in the code. In this, we implement and run a naive bayes classification, rank naive bayes classification and do some exploratory analysis with the keras library.

The second file is Neural_Network.ipynb. Here you will see our attempt at running a keras implementation of an LSTM network to achieve 85% accuracy in classifying headlines.

The third file is Simple_Classifiers.py. This is simply the first file but converted to \*.py format. This was needed so that the functions from that file could be reused in the next file.

The last important file in this directory is Hidden_Markov_Model.ipynb. Here we attempt to use an HMM to generate artificial headlines using the data to train on.
